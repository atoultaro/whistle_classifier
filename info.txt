to to list:

1. DONE - normalize the features => done Jan 31, 20212am

2. check the results why classification fails by finding the sound selection tables and sound files and then seeing them in Raven.

3. visualize the features so that it can train me to recognize species

4. use MAP as the metric instead of average F1

5. *** Data augmentation.

6. attention visualization

7. DONE - BUG - watkin sound selection tables have multiple column names => solved! Feb 1, 2021

8. DONE - Clean out the four functions "extract_feature_DEPLOYMENT": conf_time_multi & conf_time_multi_hop are redundant.

9. remove the part "48kHz" from the dataset names

10. restructure the folder structure; move the 48kHz raw sounds into the working main folder

11. *** Add clip ID into sound selection tables

12. *** Implement the script of merging sound selection tables

13. remove the '__48kHz' from the dataset names

14, change deployment name: all_cuts => allcuts; best_cuts=> bestbuts; add 'dclde2011' to dclde2011

Data requirements:

1. single channel

2. sampling rate = 48 kHz

3. 16 bits


Program preference:

1. Raven program from Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell University for sound spectrogram visualization

2. The program will generate "sound selection tables" to focus on whistle sound clips, instead of the long sparse
soundscape sounds.
