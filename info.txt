to to list:

1. DONE - normalize the features => done Jan 31, 20212am

2. check the results why classification fails by finding the sound selection tables and sound files and then seeing them in Raven.

3. visualize the features so that it can train me to recognize species

4. use MAP as the metric instead of average F1

5. *** Data augmentation.

6. attention visualization

7. DONE - BUG - watkin sound selection tables have multiple column names => solved! Feb 1, 2021

8. DONE - Clean out the four functions "extract_feature_DEPLOYMENT": conf_time_multi & conf_time_multi_hop are redundant.

9. ** remove the part "48kHz" from the dataset names
eg. STR_STAR2000_48kHz_s396_12913.wav remove 48kHz

10. restructure the folder structure; move the 48kHz raw sounds into the working main folder

11. Done - *** Add clip ID into sound selection tables

12. *** Implement the script of merging sound selection tables

13 **change deployment name: all_cuts => allcuts; best_cuts=> bestbuts; add 'dclde2011' to dclde2011;

14. Many BD in Watkin sounds were not detected by whistleness. The sound length could be too short.

15. Add the clips from watkin (whistle only) to the training of whistleness

16. Add a tree structure




Data requirements:

1. single channel

2. sampling rate = 48 kHz

3. 16 bits


Program preference:

1. Raven program from Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell University for sound spectrogram visualization

2. The program will generate "sound selection tables" to focus on whistle sound clips, instead of the long sparse
soundscape sounds.
